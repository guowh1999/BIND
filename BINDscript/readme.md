# BIND script

BIND provides a useful tool for analyzing missing values(NAs) in a biological perspective.

It consists of 3 part, BIND_stat(A), BIND_classification(B), and BIND_ppi(C). This folder contains the command line run scripts for the three parts of BIND, and the source code is available to the user. In addition, this document describes how to run BIND from the command line.

The file folder holds the example data and the results of running the example data. In addition, the format requirements for the input file are provided at the end of this document.

## BIND_stat üìä

The first part is BIND_stat, which works as a general statistical analysis of missing values in a proteomic dataset.

The input data are 2: expression matrix and group information.
There are 4 parameters,

---
**data_mtx_dir**: the expression data matrix file;

**grp_info_dir**: the group information file;

**grp_name**: the group type you tend to analysis, it must be one of the column names of grp_info file;

**output_dir**: analysis result output position;

---

A running example:

```
Rscript BIND_stat.R --data_mtx_dir "./files/data.csv" --grp_info_dir "./files/group_info.csv" --grp_name "Tissue" --output_dir "./files/outputfiles/stat"
```

Output file:

**binary_mtx.csv**: A matrix after transfering the data marix with 1/0;

**overall_stat.csv**: overall NA ratio and statistics (missing value number / total sample number);

**group_stat.csv**: NA ratio by groups.

**img_pie.csv** file for creating a pie chart (see image description)

**img_grpvsnogrp_stat.csv** file for creating a group x-y scatter plot (see image description)

**img_grp_naproportion_tree.newick** tree file for clustering group_stat.csv

**img_binary_tree.newick** tree file for creating a clustering tree of binary_mtx (see image description)

## BIND_classification üè∑Ô∏è

BIND_classification provides an agrithom for classfying "biological" and "technical" NAs.
The input file is same with BIND_stat. There are 7 parameters:

---
**data_mtx_dir**: the expression data matrix file;

**grp_info_dir**: the group information file;

**grp_name**: the group type you tend to analysis, it must be one of the column names of grp_info file;

**output_dir**: analysis result output position;

**grp**: the specific group you interested in.

**k**: neighbour number of classification, an integer.

**th**: threshold for classfying NA type, an integer.

---


A running example:

```
RScript BIND_classification.R --data_mtx_dir "./files/data.csv" --grp_info_dir "./files/group_info.csv" --grp_name "Tissue" --output_dir "./files/outputfiles/class" --grp "Breast" --k 5 --th 5
```

Output file:

**aftercalssification_label.csv**: a data matrix with NA labeled as "biological" or "technical", for user download, and for next stap analysis.

**aftercalssification_mtx.csv**: after transfering "biological"NA as 0 and "technical"NA as 0.5, other values as 1. This file for creating a heatmap.

**aftercalssification_groupmarkers.csv**: group specific markers found by BIND, for user download and creating a heatmap.

## BIND_ppi üñáÔ∏è

BIND_ppi weighted the Spearman correlation analysis, by concerning NA in calculation. 

There are 9 parameters:

---
**data_mtx_dir**: the expression data matrix file;

**grp_info_dir**: the group information file;

**grp_name**: the group type you tend to analysis, it must be one of the column names of grp_info file;

**output_dir**: analysis result output position;

**grp**: the specific group you interested in.

**reward**: the reward of NA appears together, default 0.01.

**penalty**: the penalty of NA don't appear together, default 0.01.

**NAtype_mtx_dir**: the NA type matrix from BIND_classification's output file *aftercalssification_label.csv*

**protein_list_dir**: the protein list you interested in, .csv file with one column only. Prefer 20-100 proteins.

---

**9606protein_physical_v12.txt** is a provided human PPI database, which is used in this script, it should be put at same path of BIND_ppi.R. If the file is a 7z compressed file, unzip it and save the txt file in the appropriate location.

User can specify a target group by using --grp, and get a group-specific BIND ppi. If --grp is not defined, BIND_ppi will cauculate based on the full data matrix.

Becuse calculating all protein pairs in the data matrix is too time-consuming, we can focus on user's interested proteins, by input a protein list (--protein_list_dir).

A running example:

```
RScript BIND_ppi.R --data_mtx_dir "./files/data.csv" --grp_info_dir "./files/group_info.csv"  --grp_name "Tissue"  --output_dir "./files/ppi"  --reward 0.05 --penalty 0.05 --NAtype_mtx_dir "./files/outputfiles/class/aftercalssification_label.csv"  --protein_list_dir "./files/testpros.csv"
```

If --grp has been defined, the output are:

**BINDppi_groupdiff.csv**: Spearman rho(raw_raw in file), BIND_rho(weighted_rho in file) of both target group and other samples.

**BINDppi_groupdiff_filtered.csv**: After filtered by restricted conditions, it shows target group-specific ppi found by BIND(weighted_rho). Max 200 rows. This file for construct a ppi network.

If --grp has not been defined, the output are:

**BINDppi_withoutgroup.csv**: Spearman rho(raw_raw in file), BIND_rho(weighted_rho in file) of full matrix.

**BINDppi_withoutgroup_filtered.csv**: After filtered by restricted conditions, it shows specific ppi found by BIND compared with Spearman rho.

***Expression Matrix*** with missing values:

|          | Sample1 | Sample2 | Sample3 | Sample4| ... |
| ---      | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---    | --- |
| Protein1 | 5.5     | NA      | 3.2     | 7.6    | ... |

| ...      | ...     |  ...    | ...     | ...    | ... |

Tips:

* Columns are samples and rows are proteins.
* The sample names and protein names should not contain special characters, like: . , - ‚Äî‚Äî [ { ( etc. Underline _ is acceptable where it is unavoidable.
* The sample names and protein names should start with an alphabet, such as A549, HeLa, HCT116... and EGFR, CXCR4, ...
* Official gene symbol is strongly recommended. In any case, we recommend that users pre-convert the protein name to official gene symbols if they are not.
* Protein expression values should be log converted.
* The total size limit of uploaded files is 50MB.

***Group Information*** of samples:

| Sample  | Grouptype1 | Grouptype2 | ... |
| ---     | ---        | ---        | --- |
| Sample1 | lung       | cancer     | ... |
| Sample2 | lung       | normal     | ... |
| Sample3 | stomach    | normal     | ... |
| Sample4 | skin       | cancer     | ... |
| ...     | ...        | ...        | ... |

Tips:

* Sample names should be in the first column, the order is recommended to match with column names in the expression matrix.
* There may be multiple columns to indicate multiple kinds of grouping, while each column should have a unique and easily distinguishable name.
* Each data in this table also should meet the requirements of the sample name.
