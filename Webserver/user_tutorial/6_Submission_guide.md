#### Mandatory files and parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ---       | ---         |
| Task name |  User-specified name of the task. Each task should have a name. |
| Task type | There are 3 kinds of tasks, indicating 3 modules of BIND. Choose the module you want to run.|
| *Expression Matrix* | .csv, A protein matrix with protein expression value and missing values.|
| *Group Information* | .csv, Grouping information for each sample. The first column must be the sample name in the Expression Matrix.|

#### NA statistics
| Parameter | Description |
| ---       | ---         |
| Group_name | The column name in which you are interested in the Group Information file. |

#### NA classification
| Parameter | Description |
| ---       | ---         |
| Grp |  The specific group you are interested in. Eg. cancer |
| k   |  Neighbour number in NA classification step, an integer. Eg. 5 |
| th  |  Threshold for classifying NA type. Eg. 2.5 |

#### NA-assisted PPI analysis
| Parameter | Description |
| ---       | ---         |
| Grp |  The specific group you are interested in. Eg. cancer |
| reward | The reward parameter for simultaneously appeared NA. Eg. 0.01 |
| penalty   |  the penalty parameter for not simultaneously appearing NA. Eg. 0.01 |
| *Query Protein List*  |  .csv, only contains 1 column of the interested proteins for PPI analysis. The proteins should all be in the row names of ***Expression Matrix***. No column name is needed. |

***Expression Matrix*** with missing values:

|          | Sample1 | Sample2 | Sample3 | Sample4| ... |
| ---      | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---    | --- |
| Protein1 | 5.5     | NA      | 3.2     | 7.6    | ... |
| Protein2 | NA      | NA      | 3.1     | 8.5    | ... |
| Protein3 | NA      | 2.0     | 4.3     | NA     | ... |
| Protein4 | 3.2     | 9.0     | NA      | NA     | ... |
| ...      | ...     |  ...    | ...     | ...    | ... |

Tips:

* Columns are samples and rows are proteins.
* The sample names and protein names should not contain special characters, like: . , - ‚Äî‚Äî [ { ( etc. Underline _ is acceptable where it is unavoidable.
* The sample names and protein names should start with an alphabet, such as A549, HeLa, HCT116... and EGFR, CXCR4, ...
* Official gene symbol is strongly recommended. In any case, we recommend that users pre-convert the protein name to official gene symbols if they are not.
* Protein expression values should be log converted.
* The total size limit of uploaded files is 50MB.

***Group Information*** of samples:

| Sample  | Grouptype1 | Grouptype2 | ... |
| ---     | ---        | ---        | --- |
| Sample1 | lung       | cancer     | ... |
| Sample2 | lung       | normal     | ... |
| Sample3 | stomach    | normal     | ... |
| Sample4 | skin       | cancer     | ... |
| ...     | ...        | ...        | ... |

---
Tips:

* Sample names should be in the first column, the order is recommended to match with column names in the expression matrix.
* There may be multiple columns to indicate multiple kinds of grouping, while each column should have a unique and easily distinguishable name.
* Each data in this table also should meet the requirements of the sample name.
